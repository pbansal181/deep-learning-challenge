#Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

We have given a nonprofit foundation's(Alphabet Soup) dataset in csv format and this organization wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.

We are creating a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup using Machine Learning and Neural Networks

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

Firstly, we remove the non-beneficial ID columns which are EIN' and 'NAME'. The 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' columns is considered as target variable while 'APPLICATION_TYPE' and 'CLASSIFICATION' are used for binning purpose

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
